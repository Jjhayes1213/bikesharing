## Summary
The NY Citi Bike Ride Share data was gathered from the HUB around Yonkers.  We can gather from this data that the bike-share program is being used mainly for people commuting to and from work.  The usage of these bikes significantly decreases over the weekend.  We also see that the subcribers are using this bike share program regurally, so the benefits of being a memebr seem to be aligned with the customers and their needs.  To get a better picture it would be good to know the location of the bike hubs, I would liek to include a map with pin locations showing where the bikes can be rented from.  Another good visual comparison would be to have the results from bike sharing in each of the bouroughs of New York.  The additional areas could tell more to the story of age groups, genders, and frequency of usage of the bike share program.
